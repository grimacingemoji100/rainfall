Question 3 of '27319: Version control with a focus on GitHub and R'

This repository contains an analysis of average rainfall in Oxford and Melbourne over time.

To run this analysis to create a graph, run these commands in order:
```
Rscript src/combine-data.R 
Rscript src/make-plot.R 
```

The raw datasets are in `data`, the R scripts are in `scr`, and the R script outputs are in `out`.
